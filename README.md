# Welcome to our Github Repo!

## Vision
Our vision for this project is to build a web repository based on images collected by low-cost digital microscopy in order to provide clinical samples on neglected tropical diseases for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based diagnostics.

## Target audiences
- We will tailor our platform to direct use specifically by (1) Scientists (Global Health, Computer Science, Biomedical Engineering, etc.), (2) Health personnel (clinicians, technicians, pathologists, etc.) in limited-resource settings.
- We will also target two specific audiences by disease area: (1) Malaria and (2) Leishmaniasis.
